# partyrentalwebsite
This was a HTML/PHP and MySQL College Group Assignment, where myself and two others were tasked with implementing a website for a hypothetical party rental service firm. As part of my contribution, I implemented a Clock In functionality for employees to clock in and out everyday, along with other functionality.

We submitted this assignment on 10th March 2021. We scored a first (1-1), 70%.
